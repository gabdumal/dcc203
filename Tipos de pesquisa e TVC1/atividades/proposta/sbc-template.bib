  abstract = {Plasmodium of a cellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a unique living substrate proved to be efficient in solving many computational problems with natural spatial parallelism. The plasmodium solves a problem represented by a configuration of source of nutrients by building an efficient foraging and intra-cellular transportation network. The transportation networks developed by the plasmodium are similar to transport networks built by social insects and simulated trails in multi-agent societies. In the paper we are attempting to answer the question “How close plasmodium of P. polycephalum approximates man-made motorway networks in Spain and Portugal, and what are the differences between existing motorway structure and plasmodium network of protoplasmic tubes?”. We cut agar plates in a shape of Iberian peninsula, place oat flakes at the sites of major urban areas and analyse the foraging network developed. We compare the plasmodium network with principle motorways and also analyse man-made and plasmodium networks in a framework of planar proximity graphs.},

  abstract   = {Balancing is commonly considered critical to any game's success. However, there is no consensus on what ``game balancing'' actually means. This paper examines fourteen publications by experienced game designers and other renowned authors. The results of a formal semantic analysis of the respective authors' reflections prove that no two authors share identical understandings of ``game balancing.'' Their differing concepts of the term are analyzed and discussed in order to identify key aspects, similarities, and differences. Contrary to what one might expect, concepts such as fairness, flow, or user satisfaction are identified to be important, but no central or fundamental concepts for the definition of game balancing.},

@article{kay_stepwise_2022,
  abstract  = {The true slime mould, Physarum polycephalum, develops as a vascular network of protoplasm, connecting node-like sources of food in an effort to solve multi-objective transport problems. The organism first establishes a dense and continuous mesh, reinforcing optimal pathways over time through constructive feedbacks of protoplasmic streaming. Resolved vascular morphologies are the result of an evolutionarily-refined mechanism of computation, which can serve as a versatile biological model for network design at the urban scale. Existing digital Physarum models typically use positive reinforcement mechanisms to capture meshing and refinement behaviours simultaneously. While these automations generate accurate descriptions of sensory and constructive feedback, they limit stepwise design control, reducing flexibility and applicability. A model that decouples the two “phases” of Physarum behaviour would enable multistage control over network growth. Here we introduce such a system, first by producing a site-responsive mesh from a population of nutrient-attracted agents, and then by independently calculating from it a flexible, proximity-defined shortest-walk to produce a final network. We develop and map networks within existing urban environments that perform similarly to those biologically grown, establishing a versatile tool for bio-inspired urban network design.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models of disease transmission are used to improve our understanding of patterns of infection and to identify factors influencing them. During recent public and animal health crises, such as pandemic influenza, Ebola, Zika, foot-and-mouth disease, models have made important contributions in addressing policy questions, especially through the assessment of the trajectory and scale of outbreaks, and the evaluation of control interventions. However, their mathematical formulation means that they may appear as a “black box” to those without the appropriate mathematical background. This may lead to a negative perception of their utility for guiding policy, and generate expectations, which are not in line with what these models can deliver. It is therefore important for policymakers, as well as public health and animal health professionals and researchers who collaborate with modelers and use results generated by these models for policy development or research purpose, to understand the key concepts and assumptions underlying these models. The software application epidemix (http://shinyapps.rvc.ac.uk) presented here aims to make mathematical models of disease transmission accessible to a wider audience of users. By developing a visual interface for a suite of eight models, users can develop an understanding of the impact of various modelling assumptions – especially mixing patterns – on the trajectory of an epidemic and the impact of control interventions, without having to directly deal with the complexity of mathematical equations and programming languages. Models are compartmental or individual-based, deterministic or stochastic, and assume homogeneous or heterogeneous-mixing patterns (with the probability of transmission depending on the underlying structure of contact networks, or the spatial distribution of hosts). This application is intended to be used by scientists teaching mathematical modelling short courses to non-specialists – including policy makers, public and animal health professionals and students – and wishing to develop hands-on practicals illustrating key concepts of disease dynamics and control.},

  abstract = {Modelling the effects of antiretroviral therapy on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has shown that HIV replicates rapidly and is cleared rapidly in chronically infected individuals. Four distinct timescales have been identified: virion clearance, hours; death of productively infected CD4+ T cells, days; death of long-lived infected cells, weeks; loss of latently infected cells, months to years; and loss of HIV from the FDC network, months to years. Models of virus infection have been applied to the chronic stages of hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and show that all three infections are characterized by rapid dynamics. The efficacy and mode of action of antiviral drugs can sometimes be shown from viral-dynamic studies; the relative efficacy of different drug doses and treatment regimes can be estimated from viral-decay curves; and the rapid decay of HCV RNA suggests that interferon blocks HCV production in a dose-dependent manner. Modelling antiviral immune responses is still in its infancy, but it raises interesting quantitative questions about both cytopathic and non-cytopathic effects of CD8 T+ cells in controlling viral infections. The dynamics of lymphocyte populations in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals have been elucidated through labelling studies combined with models. Future quantitative understanding of the immune system might be speeded by a combination of experiment, formation of immunological databases, modelling and computer simulation.},

The model was used to fit in vitro data and estimate parameters characterizing HCV replication. This is the first model to our knowledge to consider both positive and negative strands of HCV RNA with an age-structured multiscale modeling approach. Using this model we also studied the effects of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in blocking HCV RNA intracellular replication and the release of new virions and fit the model to in vivo data obtained from HCV-infected subjects under therapy.},

  abstract = {The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from selfplay. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go.},
